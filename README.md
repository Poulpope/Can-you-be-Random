# Can-you-be-Random
In a paper released in 2010, Jeffrey P. Ebert and Daniel M. Wegner elaborated on an individualâ€™s randomness, meaning the ability to be as random as possible. Randomness implies both the equal probability of alternative events and the inability of an observer to make a prediction of the next event from knowledge of any previous event. However, it has been shown that human cannot behave randomly. More precisely, no set of parameters reliably engenders random responses, despite instructions to behave as randomly as possible. I want to assess randomness through a key-pressing task before providing feedbacks to interfere with responsibility and regret.
